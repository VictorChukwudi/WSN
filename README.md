# Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) for LPG Leakage Detection.
This work is the implementation of a Wireless Sensor Network in environmental monitoring - gas detection. A Wireless sensor Network is a cooperative ad-hoc network consisting of multiple detection nodes, typically identified as sensor nodes, used to gather data concerning physical or environmental conditions for analysis, monitoring, and control of these conditions through a central node (base/ master node). A WSN is also described as a cooperative network collection of organized nodes, with each node consisting of processing capability, memory, a radio frequency (RF) transceiver, and a power source, accommodating various sensors and actuators.

## Aim and Objectives
This work aims to develop an early detection LPG leakage system. To achieve 
this aim, the objectives of this work are highlighted as follows: 
1. To implement a WSN model of IoT technology in the gas detection 
system. 
2. To implement a low power wide area network technology in the gas 
detection system. 
3. To accommodate leakage detection over long distances. 
4. To identify the trade-offs between loRaWAN technology and 
commonly used wireless technologies in sensor networks.

## Technologies Used
- Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN).
- Microcontroller technology (Arduino Microcontroller board).
- Gas Sensor technology (gas sensors).
